OBJEVTIVE

The company aims to enhance its auto insurance division by leveraging data analysis to:
 1. Identify patterns in claim frequencies and amounts. 
 2. Understand the demographics and characteristics of policyholders.
 3. Develop targeted marketing strategies to attract and retain customers.

This project analyzes data on policyholders, vehicles, and claims to help an insurance company improve services, optimize premiums, and reduce costs.

INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Based on questions being answered and graphical illustrations, you can create a profile of high-earning, low-risk clients for targeted advertising. These type clients are those that usually drive private vehicles, are older, married, and reside in less dangerous areas.
Anticipated Findings: Younger subscribers or those with commercial vehicles may file claims more frequently.
Subscribers in urban areas may experience a higher frequency of claims. By classifying subscribers according to risk factors, you can carry out focused interventions, like offering safety incentives to high-risk groups.
Subscribers who are younger, married, or more educated should be the focus of marketing campaigns if the data shows that these groups generally earn more money and file fewer claims.
Preferences for vehicles: Target valuable clients with exclusive deals and discounts if certain car models or makes (luxury cars, for instance) are associated with them.
Distribution analysis can help create customer personas, such as older men who prefer commercial vehicles versus younger women who drive private vehicles.
Marketing: Create targeted campaigns based on demographic data, such as encouraging married parents to purchase family-friendly auto insurance policies.
Risk-based pricing: Adjust prices in accordance with the coverage areas. For example, high-urban areas may require higher premiums due to the higher number of claims.
Advertising Techniques: High-risk zones can focus on accident prevention strategies, whereas regional campaigns can target low-risk areas with appealing premiums and services.
Increased Risk for Parents: If parents of driving children are linked to more claims, consider enacting laws or launching driver education programs aimed at younger drivers.
Personalized Items: Offer family packages that cover multiple drivers, perhaps with extras or savings to promote safer driving.
THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
Risk-based Segmentation: To create personalized premium plans, split up your clientele according to risk variables like geography, family structure, and claim history. With targeted marketing, you can create ads that are specifically tailored to the demographics and vehicle attributes of high-value, low-risk customers.• Driver Safety Programs: Offer discounts or other benefits to families with young drivers who complete safety courses or install tracking devices in their vehicles.
