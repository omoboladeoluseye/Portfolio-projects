Our analysis reveals key insights into the trends and patterns of cholera incidence and mortality amongst the ten countries. Areas with high cholera incidence and mortality such as Nigeria, USA and China was identified, and recommendations provided for policy makers and healthcare professionals to control and prevent cholera."

    "Cholera is a disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which can spread rapidly in areas with poor sanitation and hygiene. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cholera affects millions of people worldwide each year, resulting in thousands of deaths. This report aims to analyze the world cholera dataset to identify trends, patterns, and correlations that can inform strategies for controlling and preventing cholera.\n"

The dataset includes data on cholera cases and deaths from ten different countries with emphasis on the continents of North America, South America, Asia & Africa, as well as information on sanitation, water quality, and other relevant variables. We cleaned and processed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency, and used statistical software to perform the analysis.\n"

    "Our analysis reveals the following key findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global cholera incidence: The dataset includes data on cholera cases from 10 countries, with a total of 72,753 cases reported.\n",
    "-  Infant mortality Rate: The dataset reports 152,435 (to the nearest approximate) deaths due to cholera, Diarheaa & Typhoid, with a Cholera case to mortality ratio of 47%, which is quite high from the report.\n",
    "- Trends over time: Cholera incidence and mortality was very high in the year 2006 with reported cases of 3,843 representing about 5.28% of the total Cholera cases in the 25 year period analysed and although Cholera cases have been declining over the past four years, there are still significant variations between countries and regions and neccesary interventions need to be put in placeas as the period between 2007 and 2020 showed a topsy turvy trend as cases were going up and down in between those years.\n",
    "- Correlations: There is a strong correlation between cholera incidence and poor sanitation, as well as between cholera mortality and lack of access to clean water. River is the watersource with the most cases reported as it is the most contaminated. However there is a an abnormal situation in a country like Nigeria with the highest sanitation coverage of over 11% based on the number of countries reported but also with the highest mortality rate.\n",
    "- Demographic relations: From the report and analysis, it was observed that location and population density played a major role in the number of cases reported as countries such USA, Nigeria, China and even Indonesia reported very high cases in densely populated areas especially the urban centers. This also shows the trend of cases due to urbanization rate, movement of people from the rural areas to the cities.\n",

    "Based on our analysis, we identify the following key insights and recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Targeted interventions: Cholera control efforts should be targeted towards areas with poor sanitation and hygiene, particularly in countries with high cholera incidence and mortality. Also interventions must be appropriately monitored and proper records taken to ensure that they achieve their intended goals.\n",
    "- Improved sanitation and water quality: Investing in improved sanitation and water quality infrastructure can help reduce cholera incidence and mortality. Rivers being the highest source of cases shows the government needs to invest in quality water system like borehole especially in third world countries of Africa and Asia.\n",
    "- Vaccination campaigns: Vaccination campaigns can be effective in preventing cholera outbreaks, particularly in areas with high risk of transmission.\n",
    "- Improved Rural Infrastructure: Govenrment must ensure they invest in key infrastructures especially in the rural areas to curb the high trend of migration from the rural to the urban centres, that way the population density of countries can be spread out to avoid over population of some areas especially the cities.\n",
